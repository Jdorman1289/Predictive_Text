# Text Generation with N-Grams in Shakespeare's Works

This API generates text based on the works of William Shakespeare using an N-gram model. It allows users to input a prompt and receive suggestions for the next word, enhancing the creative writing process.

## Usage

To run the API, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
python generate.py
```

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can do this by running:

```
pip install flask flask-cors
```

## Note

The script uses a pre-existing file named `shakespeare_set.txt`, which contains the text of Shakespeare's works. Ensure that this file is in the same directory as the script.

## Demo
